# WebProjects

We have created car sale system website by using HTML,CSS,PHP and MySQL. The main
aim of this project is to create an application that is helpful while selling cars.
In the existing System it is difficult to maintain the car information individually and to supply
for the customers who are eager to buy them. Customer has to face difficulty in order to know
the information of car like manufacturing year, car model and other valuable information in a
single domain. 

Our main idea is to develop a system where we can have all the required
information for the user in order to effectively interest him in the process of buying a car.
In the Proposed System, application can maintain car details like manufacturer, year of
manufacturing, price and model etc. We can also view all the car details which are kept for sale
effectively and we can search for our desired car. With this Customer can get the information
quickly like car details which have been entered clearly.



As our college is known for various kinds of events, our main aim is to unite those under the
single platform and to provide the better information of those. Even though there are many
offline ways to know about the events our database provides the accurate and updated
information of all the technical and non-technical events that are going to be conducted under
those events.Our database system and web application is designed with the motivation of managing all
types of events.
